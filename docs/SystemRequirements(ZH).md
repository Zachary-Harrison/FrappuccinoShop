# Dan's Frappuccino Paradise

Starbucks is crazy complicated. There's so many different types of coffee that it makes it very difficult to even understand what you're purchasing. So, we're going to open Dan's Frappuccino Paradise! 

- <u>Customers</u>
  - order a Frappuccino based on the options we give them. 
  - pay with money from their **account** with (essentially) unlimited money.
    - encrypt the account
    - they need a unique username and password
- <u>Employee</u> 
  - take order
  - take money from customers
  - have a button that allows them to "clock in". "Hey, I worked 3 hours"
- <u>Frappuccino Baristas</u> 
  - make the beverage and ring up the order.
  - have a button that allows them to "clock in". "Hey, I worked 3 hours"
- <u>Manager </u> 
  - Collect money
  - Stock inventory - each customer is going to use up resources. Manager keeps track of that
  - Pay workers
  - TGIF button (eagle-shits button). On friday, they hit the button and all the employees get paid. 

We're going to want to make a website for this

- This website would require different account levels
  - customer
  - barista
  - manager

In this class, money is kind of fake.
